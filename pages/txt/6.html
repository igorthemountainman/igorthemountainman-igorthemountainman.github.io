home from school, it's friday and i was looking forward to having one of those nights where i can relax because i know i have nothing going on the next day, but then i get the message that i have a 7 hour shift the very next day. that knowledge paired with my daily commute by bike which already always stresses me out + cars honking at me on my way home for biking like an idiot (which im sure is justified, i dont know road rules at all) made me want to kill myself pretty quick<br><br>upon getting home my sister shows me something. she's 3, and behaves herself as such, in good and bad ways. she shows me her new thingamabob for her ipad: a digital coloring book. "very cool" i, 17 year old depressed brother, say. "wow, that is very nice". i watch over her shoulder as she colors to let her know i really truly am invested in her work. then, her work got disrupted abruptly by an advertisement. the ones we see all the time, on those low quality mobile apps (not to act like every app in the universe doesn't have ads though). it was an ad for textiles or blankets, or maybe curtains, or something else that will never in a million years be able to serve any function to my 3 year old just-barely-conscious sister other than disrupt her play time.<br><br>i walk over to press the big button that says 'Close'. "No!" she yells at me. "Only press the X! The X! Only the X!" I apologize quickly. My parents must've been telling her things like "when you get one of those don't touch the screen anywhere except the X" because... usually the X would also close the ad.<br><br>i thought, that's weird... a grown adult developer made and published an app made for, targeted towards, and used almost exclusively by, young children. and then he put ads in it. but i mean, he must know that kid doesn't know what they're looking at, right? that that kid won't be making purchases on their own until many years from now? he must know that he is actively trying to profit and sell things to kids that are just barely in kindergarten? well, the guy gets paid either way, wether the ads turn people into purchasing customers or not. so thats most likely the reason...<br><br>and now my sister might get used to the fact that ads are everywhere. she will grow up, thinking, 'oh yeah i can do this and this and that but of course i will be sold to, of course i will  be made a consumer, thats just how things work, right? that's how it's always been.' the only reason we are annoyed by and get mad at ads is because we still grew up in a time when it wasn't the norm. when not everything had a subscription model. maybe thats why companies don't back down. because in a couple decades, every generation of consumers will have grown up in a world where you are born not as people but consumers.<br><br>of course im thinking too deep... just a thing that happened that fed my thoughts for a bit.
