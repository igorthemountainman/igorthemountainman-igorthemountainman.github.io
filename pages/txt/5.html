<p>
As much as i hate myself now and wish i could be someone else<br>
As much as i sometimes want to possess someone else's body and live their life for them<br>
Whenever i look back at who we were all those years ago<br>
I cant help but feel pride in who ive become<br>
Because however much removed i am from the person i want to be right now<br>
Im as close as ive ever been<br>
When i hear you speak about your life<br>
Our interests and mannerisms differ<br>
But the core of our spirit, and the structure that its built on, is identical<br>
I might like terraria, while you like fortnite<br>
You might like making youtube videos, while i like making music<br>
But truly we all just want the same thing<br>
Freedom in who we are<br>
Freedom to express ourselves<br>
In how we dress<br>
How we talk<br>
How we present ourselves<br>
To pursue that person<br>
That person we want to be<br>
Constantly refining and fine-tuning ourselves<br>
How we dry our hair after showers<br>
How we sway our arms when we walk<br>
The tone we speak with<br>
The things we share with others<br>
I remember how bad you wanted to be someone else then<br>
And that feeling still hasnt gone away, trust me<br>
But you'd be so proud of what i managed to make of ourselves, despite the imperfections<br>
Did you know i wear nail polish now?
