	<p>this was for a school assignment. the teacher is chill as fuck and gives me a lot of artistic freedom. for this, we watched modern times by charlie chaplin (old black and white movie from the 1930s) and then had to make an artwork with a societal commentary inspired by the movie. bc the movie is about, like, the effects of work and modern society on people and shit. i decided to revolve my shit around how productivity is often put above mental wellbeing in the workplace, and how workers are essentially prisoners, trapped not in cells but by having no other options that would keep them financially stable. im saying the meaning which i normally dont do because its pretty obvious from the image anyway. the big powerful capitalist dude watching over his minions doing his work for him, everyone obeying and standing in line like good little workers. i dont take the message that seriously tho not even gonna lie its just cus that was the assignment. teacher liked it :p</p>
