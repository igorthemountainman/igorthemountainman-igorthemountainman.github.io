	<p>first school assignment of the year: a notebook.. i was lowk traumatized from last year and our lack of freedom. teachers that sapped every milliliter of creative juice out of me, using it on sterile corporate 'art', cookbooks and logos for hospitals and festival posters, where experimentation was discouraged because 'the client might not like it'. but it is now thursday, i made that on tuesday, and i like it a lot. and i didnt get any comments. so far, its looking like... maybe... i can be an artist... and not a 'graphic designer'... it all felt very fake. step-by-step plans, a minimum of 3 sketches, a PDF with a 'moodboard' with a minimum of 6 pieces of inspiration you got off pinterest or whatever. it all felt very unorganic. i have my idea, i have it now, why not let me sit down and create so i can capture this? this time, that is exactly what happened. i thought, 'hey this could be cool', grabbed a piece of paper, a red piece of chalk and a black piece of chalk, a pencil and a black ballpoint pen, and went to work for about 15 minutes. and that was it. it didnt need to be anything else. i didnt have to sit around doing nothing for another 2 hours, because the teachers didnt believe anything substantial could be created in less than that. i got to truly just capture the lightning in a bottle like i do at home. it made me very happy and hopeful for the rest of the school year.</p>
