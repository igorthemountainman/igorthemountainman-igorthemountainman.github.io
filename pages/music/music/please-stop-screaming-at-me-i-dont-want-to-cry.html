	<p>i put this on cargocult because it was already on there and im not tryna make a whole new soundcloud profile to have it up (maybe once i hit the 3 hour mark on cargocult) <br> basically this was supposed to by my first album. ive always really loved the idea of a full length album with like 10+ tracks and an overarching aesthetic or storyline. so that was the goal for this. i had an entire rollout in mind, an outfit, everything, all to realize i need to actually make the songs before im able to do that... and i was less than a year into taking music seriously, so i ended up making 3 full songs i was happy with and a bunch of instrumental interludes because theyre easy to make and i sucked at vocals/wasnt confident at them. after a while i silently decided to cancel it. i went on to improve my craft without rushing a debut album (though i totally tried making another one a year later). so my advice for anyone else starting out that really wants to make an album: go ahead! get overexcited and caught up in the process. overwhelm yourself. you'll learn that you might not be actually be anywhere near making something youre satisfied with. but it'll be a goal, something to work towards, and you'll create good art in the pursuit of great art. its awesome practice. but also dont take my word for anything because at the time of writing im about 3 years into music so i dont really know much more than anyone else.</p>
