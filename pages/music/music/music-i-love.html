      <p>this is one of the most talented women on youtube. her voice and range is utterly insane. this video specifically brought me to tears at one point. the way the chords slide into each other combined with just the texture of her voice and her knowledge of harmony (not that i know what she's doing at all, i just know i can feel it). beautiful singer beautiful video check out her other ones</p>

      <p>one of the coolest videos of all fucking time. this guy has an aura the size of a solar system. everything from how the crowd is dressed, to how jimi hendrix moves around on stage, to the recording quality and that typical 60s saturated feel, to of course the performance itself. not just jimi hendrix going bananamode on that guitar but how the band works together: the bassist never does anything crazy, tries to hit a lick or bring attention to himself, he knows his place as a bassist (no offense) and supports what jimi is doing to maintain a consistent and strong sound. and that dummer is insane for being able to keep up with jimi seeing how unpredictable his playing is. the tone of the guitar is also insane i would LOVE to know what shit sounded like in person.</p>

      <p>this entry basically counts for any julie performance ever. this just happens to be a video i come back to a lot. i love their music but man i also love the way they perform. they don't say anything, don't make faces. the music speaks for itself. i hate when artists are like 'open up the pit!!! open up the pitt!!! HELLO TORONTO!!! moooshpit moooshpit mooooshpit'. these guys just get on stage and perform and get the fuck off. its the coolest shit ever. no emotion. the way keyan pourzand (the guitarist in the middle) moves his body and bends his knees while playing the guitar is so sick. its like he moves it in synch with the tone of the guitar, as if its an extension of his body (which is a huge compliment for anyone that plays an instrument). i also have no idea how he gets that powerful of a roaring thundering sound from his guitar. i saw them live in person and his guitar playing shakes the ground. you can feel the vibrations through the floor and up your legs, you can feel it shaking your hair and clothes, you can feel it resonating with the hollow space in your bones and you can feel your organs getting tickled. dillon lee the drummer is also fucking demolishing that set like it owns him money and i think he makes the band what it is. i love how fast yet how chill he is with it. also just a good looking dude. in fact all of them are very good looking people. i love julie. fav band ever.</p>

      <p>my favorite song ever which just so happens to be from one of my favorite artists ever. i loveee long songs that take a while to build up. everything in this song is so well put together and so polished. the noise at the start is gorgeously disgusting. its so beautifully noisy and loud and emotional. i love how cathartic the drop feels. i love the 3 seconds right before it where she fries her voice, for the first time in the song.</p>

      <p>this song has one of the hardest beats i've ever heard. its so hard and chaotic yet so elegant in a weird way. i love how the bass goes up in octaves so that it doesnt really have the kind of body a bass has anymore but then it drops back down to the original octave and just hits you in your face... sounds really great with headphones. such a beautiful song</p>

      <p>i love the long intro and how on the drop all the melodic elements and samples just dissapear. the weird thud sound takes you by surprise but the song still transitions into it super nicely. and then after that part the song goes back to 'normal' and you almost forget about that part... but then at 4:07, after a long buildup, you're expecting that same sort of feel-good energy to continue, but then it just returns to the thud sound from the first drop. idk how to explain it properly its just a really sick moment. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGKWHc60bW0&list=PLS6nznuCt0CZeQAviD6wTlOsmTslmABA-" target="blank">that whole album</a> is full of great sound design and amazing beats.</p>

      <p>one of those songs thats so gorgeously simple and relaxing. prime walking-around-at-night music. in the same vein as yume nikki to me. there's something about really obsecure analog minimalist music thats just so magical. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-ErRfoDojo&list=OLAK5uy_mIaw1O1TT3zpW3dTxlu3p_FV_Ilb6p9qw" target="blank">the whole album has songs like this if ur interested its really good</a></p>

      <p>beautiful song where the lyrics are what makes it good. something really rare for me since im usually a producerhead and i listen to the production and chords and sound design and textures and mixing and stuff (i dont even know the lyrics or meaning to 9 out of my 10 fav songs). this song is basically about a dog named brownie that went blind, and the young child of who's perspective its written from empathizing with her. the line 'you said she'd be fine, but i saw her cry, when she bumped her head against the wall, but what could you do for an old dog like you' is so so so so moving. absolute masterpiece of songwriting that, in my eyes, perfected the concept of 'show, don't tell' in songwriting. which is basically just that if your story is moving enough you won't have to describe or show how you felt during it, you just have to say what happened and that'll be moving on its own. much more so actually because the listeners imagines it playing out in their head. they just experience it and feel what they would feel in that situation. in this song im like oh my god poor fucking thing. ronnie red doesnt go 'im so sad that my dog went blind.. oh no' he just tells the story and whatever im just repeating myself. theres a lot of songs especially in like emo rap where the lyrics literally say 'i wanna kill myself and i feel depressed' which yeah if youre a teenager going thru the same thing, hearing someone describe those feelings, you'll relate to it and be like yeah i get what hes saying. but it wont move you like this kind of storytelling will. beautiful song</p>

      <p>björk is obviously the greatest vocalist of all time. i love her emotive singing and in this song she goes from literally hushing and whispering to screaming her lungs out and everything in between. i love the parts where she just screams. one of the most talented people of all time in my humble little opinion</p>
