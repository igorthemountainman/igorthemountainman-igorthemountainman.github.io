	<p>igor is a currently 17-year-old artist born, living, and based in belgium. the arts have always been an interest of mine. as a child i would draw a lot. at one point i had an entire cast of characters, living in a made-up world, led by a made-up government with a made-up legal system and economy. my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracosm" target="blank">paracosms</a> were immense in size. i would write stories as books and comics, draw maps, and make character sheets. i never took art lessons. through time i've developed my own sort of art style. i don't know anatomy. i don't understand shading or color theory. 99% of my drawings are still drawn with a ballpoint pen, no sketching or planning beforehand. i don't even have paper to draw on, i tend to doodle during classes in my workbook.<br><br>somewhere in the late 2010s, i started dipping my toes in graphic design, or <a href="../art/art.html" target="blank">whatever you want to call it.</a> around this time is when i adopted the name igorthemountainman. it started out as quadthemountainman: i had a quadeca fanpage, where i used to express my visual creativity through <a href="quadecaedits.html">quadeca edits</a> (his whole aesthetic at the time, which is 2021, was mountains). my edits eventually got weirder and weirder. i would start putting personal meaning behind the edits, viewing them more as artworks rather than edits. <a href="quadecaedits2.html" target="blank">quadeca had nothing to do with it anymore</a>. i eventually changed my name to igorthemountainman. igor just happened to be a word that looked really cool on text, in a specific font.<br><br>around june of 2022, i started taking music seriously. to this day, i produce, write, mix and master all my own music. i've even picked up some basic cinematography skills through photoshoots and music videos, which i also direct, shoot, edit and polish myself. i ended up taking music extremely seriously, to where i often get in my own way with self doubt and insecurity. it's another challenge i have to overcome as an artist.<br><br>outside of art and music, here are some fun facts about me or something.</p><br><br> 
	<ul>
		<li>i tend to be very open and vulnerable on my instagram story</li>
		<li>i founded and run a media outlet called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cut2static/" target="blank">static</a></li>
		<li>i am exceptionally bad at collaborating with people and doing features</li>
		<li>i am predominantly based on the internet. all my friends, interests, and a good chunk of my personality stems from there</li>
		<li>i was extremely secretive of my creative endeavors around my irl friends and family up until 2025</li>
		<li>i am diagnosed with autism, and i credit it for my hyperfixation and heightened creativity</li>
		<li>i don't consider myself any gender but i also don't consider myself non-binary, i just be whatever with no label, any pronouns</li>
		<li>'bevel', the name of my music project, comes from a godly character from one of my aforementioned paracosms.</li>
		<li>i have a secret project that i've been chipping away at very, very slowly since 2020. i have no clue when it's gonna be finished</li>
